Stimulus: Auditory
Manipulations: Mild Cognitive Impairment present or not
Feedback: Reproducing duration of given stimulus interval
Subject demographics: Fifteen subjects with the diagnosis of amnestic Mild-Cognitive Impairment (aged 58–81, M = 72.9, SD = 6.4; seven females) as well as 44 healthy aged controls (aged 60–84, M = 72.2, SD = 5.1; 24 females)
Type of response device used: keyboard
Experiment setting: A MacBook Pro (13”, 2011) controlled all experimental events. 
Training: 20 trials 1-s reproduction
The primary aim of the experiment:  Investigating whether mild cognitive impairment results in timing deficiencies.
Main result of the study:  Patients with aMCI showed the strongest regression towards the mean in a multi-duration reproduction task, followed by low-performing healthy controls and high-performing healthy controls, respectively.
