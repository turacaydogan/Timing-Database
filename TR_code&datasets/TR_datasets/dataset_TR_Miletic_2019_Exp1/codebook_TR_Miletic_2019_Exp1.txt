Stimulus: Participants produced a duration of 1.5 s by pressing the space bar twice – once to start the interval, and once to end the interval. Before the start of the interval, a fixation cross was presented, which changed to a circle upon the first keypress.
Manipulations: No manipulations
Feedback: After the second keypress, participants received feedback on how well they reproduced the interval, indicated by a colored circle that represented how close they were to the target duration. This feedback was presented for a random duration sampled uniformly between 1 s and 1.5 s.

Age: Mean 21.5y (SD 1.9y)
Type of the response device used: keyboard
Experiment setting: Lab
Training: 10 familiarization trials (not included)
Primary aim of experiment: Provide insight in the role of timing in decision making
Special instructions: Participants were explicitly instructed not to count or tap their fingers or feet to reproduce the duration.

Additional tasks: All subjects also performed a decision making task under deadline stress. The deadline was set at 1.5s This always followed the time production task
