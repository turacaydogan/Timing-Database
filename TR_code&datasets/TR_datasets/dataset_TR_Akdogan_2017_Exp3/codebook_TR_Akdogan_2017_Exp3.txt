Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 146(3), 347–361. https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000265Stimulus: VisualManipulations: Two target durations, 3 and 6 seconds, were presented 45 times in both test blocks.Feedback: NoneSubject demographics: Healthy subjects (Mean age = 20.1, SD = 2.0)Type of response device used: KeyboardExperiment setting: LabTraining: Presentation of two target durations twice in random order.  The primary aim of the experiment: Further validation of temporal error monitoring ability with doubled target durations (compared to 1.5 and 3 seconds in Experiment 2) and to investigate the effect of temporal context (i.e. two targets, variable block).Main result of the study: Underreproduction of the long target in the fixed blocks, and overreproduction of the short target duration. Shifts observed in temporal reproductions were due to context effects. Temporal error monitoring ability was observed. Special instructions: Participants were instructed not to count aloud or subvocally throughout the experiment.Date of data collection: 2017Location of data collection: Koc University, Istanbul/Turkey; TurkishData formatted by: Serkan Salcan (serkansalcann@gmail.com)
