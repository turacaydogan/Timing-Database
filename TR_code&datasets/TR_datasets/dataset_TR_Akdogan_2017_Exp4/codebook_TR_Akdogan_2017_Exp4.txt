Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 146(3), 347–361. https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000265Stimulus: VisualManipulations: Two different groups were tested for target interval of 1.5 and 3 seconds.Feedback: NoneSubject demographics: Healthy subjects (Mean age = 22.8, SD = 3.4 )Type of response device used: KeyboardExperiment setting: LabTraining: Presentation of target duration. The primary aim of the experiment: Validation of temporal error monitoring ability by eliminating the temporal context effects arise from using multiple target intervals.Main result of the study: Highly accurate repreoductions in both groups. Temporal error monitoring ability was observed when single interval was used per group.Special instructions: Participants were instructed not to count aloud or subvocally throughout the experiment.Date of data collection: 2017Location of data collection: Koc University, Istanbul/Turkey; TurkishData formatted by: Serkan Salcan (serkansalcann@gmail.com)
