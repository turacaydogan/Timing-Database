Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 146(3), 347–361. https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000265Stimulus: VisualManipulations: Two target durations, 2.1 and 4.2 seconds, were presented with equal probability.Feedback: NoneSubject demographics: Healthy subjects (Mean age = 21.5, SD = 3.2)Type of response device used: KeyboardExperiment setting: LabTraining: Presentation of two target durations twice in random order.The primary aim of the experiment: Investigation of temporal error monitoring ability.Main result of the study: Temporal reproductions were highly accurate in fixed blocks but migration observed in variable blocks. Participants were able to monitor their temporal estimates such that they reported lower confidencefor large errors and were able to distinguish the direction of their temporal errors in both fixed and variable blocks.Special instructions: Participants were instructed not to count aloud or subvocally throughout the experiment.Date of data collection: 2017Location of data collection: Koc University, Istanbul/Turkey; TurkishData formatted by: Serkan Salcan (serkansalcann@gmail.com)
