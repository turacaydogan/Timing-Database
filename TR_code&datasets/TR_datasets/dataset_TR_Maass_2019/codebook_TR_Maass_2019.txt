Stimulus: Auditory
Manipulations: changes in the instructions and types of pitches varied.
Feedback: Reproducing duration of given stimulus interval
Subject demographics: 138
Type of response device used: keyboard
Experiment setting: MacBooks (13″, 2009) controlled all experimental events. Auditory stimuli were presented through headphones (Sennheiser, HD280 Pro)
Training: 
The primary aim of the experiment:  An example in the temporal domain is the central tendency effect: when a range of durations is presented, a regression towards the mean is observed. 
Main result of the study:  We demonstrate that (1) the context effect emerges as long as sufficiently distinct durations are presented; (2) the effect is not modulated by explicit instructions or other cues; (3) just a single additional duration is sufficient to produce a context effect.
Special instructions: Temporal Reproduction
Date of data collection: 2019
instruction data:no label=no further instructions were given about the lengths of intervals in each block
		pitch=In the next blocks, you will hear durations with different pitches. The pitch changes from block to block
		short/long=In the next blocks, you will either hear SHORTer or LONGer durations. This will be indicated at the start of each block.
		A/B=In the next blocks, you will hear durations from SET A or SET B. This will be indicated at the start of each block.
