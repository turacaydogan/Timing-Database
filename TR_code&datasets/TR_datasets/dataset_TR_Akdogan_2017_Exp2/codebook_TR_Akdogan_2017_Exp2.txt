Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 146(3), 347–361. https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0000265Stimulus: VisualManipulations: Two target durations, 1.5 and 3 seconds, were presented with equal probability.Feedback: NoneSubject demographics: Healthy subjects (Mean age = 20.9, SD = 2.5)Type of response device used: KeyboardExperiment setting: LabTraining: Presentation of two target durations twice in random order. The primary aim of the experiment: To establish generality of temporal error monitoring ability using different interval ranges. Main result of the study: In both blocks overproduction of short target and highly accurate reproduction of long target.Participants were able to monitor their temporal estimates. Special instructions: Participants were instructed not to count aloud or subvocally throughout the experiment.Date of data collection: 2017Location of data collection: Koc University, Istanbul/Turkey; TurkishData formatted by: Serkan Salcan (serkansalcann@gmail.com)
