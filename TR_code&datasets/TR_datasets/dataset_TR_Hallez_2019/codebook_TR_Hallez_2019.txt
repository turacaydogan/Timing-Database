The dynamic effect of context on interval timing in children and adults. Acta Psychologica, 192, 87-93. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2018.10.004Stimulus: VisualManipulations: two age groups and two temporal context condition (short context targets: 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9 s & long context targets: 0.9, 1, 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 s; a within-subject variable). Two temporal context was tested in different days.Feedback: No feedback was provided.Subject demographics: Children aged from 5 to 7 years and college students (mean age = 20.43, SD=3.94)Type of response device used: KeyboardExperiment setting: LabTraining:Participants were given 10 demonstration trials (5 demonstrations and 5 practice trials) before each temporal condition. Consequently, they experienced each duration of the context conditions twice.The primary aim of the experiment: To investigate the effect of temporal context in children and adults.Main result of the study: 1)Underestimation of repreduced duration by children as the length of durations increased. 2)Central tendecy effect was oberved in both age groups but it was stronger in children. 3) Temporal precision increased by age. 4) Children relied on targets presented in previous trials more for current reproductions while adults relied on subjective produced durations more.Special instructions: No information was found.Date of data collection: 2019Location of data collection:FranceData formatted by: Serkan Salcan (serkansalcann@gmail.com)
