Stimulus: Auditory
Manipulations: Different types of temporal reproduction procedures
Feedback: Reproducing duration of given stimulus
Subject demographics: Thirty healthy participants (13 males, mean age was 
24.5 years, ranging from 18 to 37) 
Type of response device used: keyboard
Experiment setting: Sounds were delivered via headphones (Stereo TW-260A)
Training: no training
The primary aim of the experiment: it is investigated the possibility that negative reproduction errors can be explained by the tendency to prefer earlier over later response times, or whether the whole range of possible response times is shifted.
Main result of the study:  The results demonstrate that the bias towards earlier responses not only affects reproduction of the exact time point of equality
