Stimulus: Auditory
Manipulations: strong vs. weak auditory stimulus  1:standard durations in mixed blocks 2:each modality combination was tested in separate blocks 3:only the standard durations were blocked
Feedback: Participants pressed space key to reproduce the given stimulus time
Subject demographics: 16 women and 8 men, M = 23.9 years
Type of response device used: Space key of a keyboard
Experiment setting: soundattenuated, dimly illuminated experimental booth
Training: Participants completed 8 training trials same with the experimental trials
The primary aim of the experiment: whether PCM applicable for intramodal (strong vs. weak auditory) time reproduction
Main result of the study:  the mean reproduction results confirmed the predictions of PCM in many respects, with a better match for the long than for the short standard duration
