Stimulus: Visual and Auditory
Manipulations: 1:standard durations in mixed blocks 2:each modality combination was tested in separate blocks 3:only the standard durations were blocked
Feedback: Participants pressed space key to reproduce the given stimulus time
Subject demographics: 1a: 18 women and 6 men, M = 20.4 years; Experiment 1b: 17 women and 7 men, M = 20.6 years;Experiment 1c: 22 women and 2 men, M = 21.9 years
Type of response device used: Space key of a keyboard
Experiment setting: soundattenuated, dimly illuminated experimental booth
Training: Participants completed 8 training trials same with the experimental trials
The primary aim of the experiment: whether PCM applicable for intermodal time reproduction
Main result of the study:  PCM predictions were supported in intermodal design
Special instructions: Temporal Reproduction Task
