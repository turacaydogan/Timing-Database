Stimulus: Visual
Manipulations: blue or pink visual stimulus  1:standard durations in mixed blocks 2:each modality combination was tested in separate blocks 3:only the standard durations were blocked
Feedback: Participants pressed space key to reproduce the given stimulus time
Subject demographics: 19 women and 5 men, M = 22.8 years
Type of response device used: Space key of a keyboard
Experiment setting: soundattenuated, dimly illuminated experimental booth
Training: Participants completed 8 training trials same with the experimental trials
The primary aim of the experiment: whether PCM applicable for intramodal (blue or pink visual stimulus) time reproduction
Main result of the study: Congruency effects on mean reproduction and reproduction variability can emerge even when the change in the stimulus is quite subtle and does not affect perceived duration.
Special instructions: Temporal Reproduction Task
Date of data collection: 2019
Location of data collection: University of Tübingen
Special Note: Congruency data included 1:congruent 0:incongruent
