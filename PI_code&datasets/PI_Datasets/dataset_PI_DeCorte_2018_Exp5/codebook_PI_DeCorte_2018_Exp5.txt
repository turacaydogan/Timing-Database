Stimulus: Auditory & Visual
Manipulations: Changing responses to differentiations in cue time
Feedback: In the form of nosepoke
Subject demographics: 20 naïve, male, Sprague-Dawley rats, who were 2 – 3 months of age at the start of each experiment
Type of response device used: Three nosepoke apertures, equipped with photobeam detection circuits
Experiment setting: Lab
Training: During nosepoke training, rats were trained to insert their snouts into the center nosepoke in order to earn reward. Each response (snout insertion) resulted in reward delivery.  
The primary aim of the experiment: To compare different contexts (environments) on changing cue times.
Main result of the study:   violating the purported ‘covariance assumption’ blocks cross-cue transfer
Special instructions: Peak interval task
Date of data collection: 2018
Location of data collection: Not known
Special Note: Data where the subjects responded before the trial began are omitted to 0.
