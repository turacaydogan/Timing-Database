Stimulus: Visual and Auditory
Manipulations: Stimulus compounding
Feedback: Rats head entry into food pellet
Subject demographics: Thirty adult male Sprague–Dawley rats
Type of response device used: Three nosepoke response apertures (2.5 cm opening diameter) with photobeam detection circuits were placed on the back wall of the chamber and had yellow and green LED cue lights in their interior. 
Experiment setting: 10 standard operantconditioning chambers (30.5  25.4  30.5 cm; Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA).
Training: Training continued until rats earned 60 reinforcements on two sequential sessions.
The primary aim of the experiment: Whether the time at which the compound response functions peaked was systematically related to the reinforcement probabilities of the component durations
Main result of the study:  The results of Experiment 2 show that the form of compound
responding in tone-short/light-long rats varied as the ratio of reinforcement densities increased from slightly favoring the short duration to heavily favoring the short duration.
Special instructions: Peak Interval
Date of data collection: 2009
Location of data collection: Unknown
Note:Short and long stimuli are counterbalanced
