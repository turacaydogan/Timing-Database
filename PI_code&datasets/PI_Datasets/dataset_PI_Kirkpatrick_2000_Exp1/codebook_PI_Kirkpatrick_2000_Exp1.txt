Stimulus: Visual and Auditory
Manipulations: Different durations of peak intervals and cycles
Feedback: Rats head entry into food pellet
Subject demographics: 24 male Sprague-Dawley rats
Type of response device used: LEDphotocell (Model ENV-254)
Experiment setting: The 12 chambers (25 x 30 x 30 cm) were located inside ventilated, noise-attenuating boxes (74 x 38 x 60 cm). Each chamber was equipped with a food cup, a water bottle, and two levers.
Training: Original training, trace interval training, original training-2 were performed before Peak interval procedure-1 (Sessions 66-100), omission training were performed before Peak Interval Training-2 (Sessions 131-135) 
The primary aim of the experiment: Serial-, parallel-, and single-process accounts of conditioning and timing are compared.
Main result of the study: All of the response rate functions peaked near the expected time of reinforcement, relative to stimulus onset. Shorter stimulus durations resulted in local response rate functions that were narrower and had higher peak rates than longer stimulus durations.
Special instructions: Peak Interval Procedure
stimulus/cycle combinations: 120/180 (Conditions 1 and 2), 60/180 (Condition 3 and 4), or 30/180 (Conditions 5 and 6).
