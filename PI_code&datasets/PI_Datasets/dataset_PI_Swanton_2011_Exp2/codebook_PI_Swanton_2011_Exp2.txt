Stimulus: Visual and Auditory
Manipulations: Stimulus compounding
Feedback: Rats head entry into food pellet
Subject demographics: Twenty adult male Sprague–Dawley rats
Type of response device used: Three nosepoke response apertures (2.5 cm opening diameter) with photobeam detection circuits were placed on the back wall of the chamber and had yellow and green LED cue lights in their interior. 
Experiment setting: 10 standard operantconditioning chambers (30.5  25.4  30.5 cm; Coulbourn Instruments, Allentown, PA).
Training: Rats were reinforced with a sucrose pellet on a fixed ratio 1 schedule on the center nosepoke aperture, until 60 reinforcers had been earned or 2 hr elapsed.
The primary aim of the experiment: Stimulus compounding in interval timing
Main result of the study:  The modality–duration relationship of the anchor durations results in qualitatively different response patterns to the compound cue
Special instructions: Peak Interval
Date of data collection: 2008
Location of data collection: Unknown
