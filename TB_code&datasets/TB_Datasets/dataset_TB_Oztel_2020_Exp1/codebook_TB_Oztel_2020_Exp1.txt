dataset_TB_Oztel_2020_Exp1.csv file includes data from Experiment 1.
Stimulus: Forward-walking stick man videos with 25, 50 and 100 frame per second (fps) speeds.
Manipulations: The speed of the walking stick man. In the dataset, "Condition" column depicts the walking speed of the stick man for each trial. Participants reported their confidence (1: low, 2: medium, 3: high confidence) after each categorization. These responses are in the Confidence_Rating column.
Feedback: Participants received no feedback throughout the experiment.
Subject demographics: 10 F/4 M, 25 right handed, Mean age = 24.4, SD age =2.8
Type of response device used: A mechanical keyboard.
Experiment setting: Lab
Training: Participants classified durations as being "short" or "long". The training session terminated once the participant reached 10 correct classifications.
The primary aim of the experiment: Investigating whether participants were aware of their time perceptions biased by exogenous factors.
