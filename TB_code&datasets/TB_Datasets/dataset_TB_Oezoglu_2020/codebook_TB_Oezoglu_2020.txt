Stimulus: 100x100 blue square simultaneously presented with a tone. Two tones were used, for high and low arousal. In the column "Condition", 1 refers to low arousal tone, 2 refers to high arousal tone. Tones were 698 (Low) and 704 (High) taken from IADS battery.
Manipulations: Arousal manipulation via emotional sound - high and low arousal tones with similar valence values. see Stimulus section for more details.
Feedback: No feedback

Type of the response device used: Keyboard
Experiment setting: Lab
The primary aim of the experiment: To investigate if interoceptive accuracy associated with emotion-induced time dilation.
Main result of the study: Higher interoceptive accuracy is correlated with less time dilation effect.
